# Cuisiner 

Backend: Spring Boot
Frontend: React Native as we can develop for both iOS and Android with it.

MVP:

1) User registration / log in
2) Feed (very basic, just a repository of user's cooking history)
3) Ability to post dish onto feed 
   -Title
   -Description
   -Ingredients (selected from ingredients database so later users can tap onto an ingredient and see dishes, kind of like hashtags)
- 
Recipe (can link to recipe or write own) Eventually find a way to make recipe DB.
